            <p>I know Robot fight club would be RFC but Robox also sounds pretty cool. Basically
                this is a place where you can find intense robot fights, with much more freedom 
                for design than the official sumo robot fights. The only restriction is the size
                but besides that you could submit any kind of design for a robot. Just look at 
                spider chicken here, the first robot to take part in free for all, no rules, robot fights.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this page you will find videos for awesome robot fights and have the ability to submit
                designs which people will vote on. The most popular designs move on to the next round off
                battles. You can also take part in piloting one of the robots if you are the designer, unless
                you would like someone else to pilot your robot for you. Take a look at our robot piloting 
                interface and tutorials if you're interested in driving one of these bad boys one day. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't just watch the robots in action, you could also take some tutorials in order to learn 
                how to design, build and control your very own robots! We also have tutorials for the build 
                of each of the robots that take part in the robot fights.
